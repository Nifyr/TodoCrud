# TodoCrud
## Tech Stack
Frontend: Windows Forms (C#)

Backend: ASP.NET Core Web API (C#)

Database: SQLite with Entity Framework Core (local file-based database)

Testing: MSTest (C#)

## Build and Run
I'm using Visual Studio 2022 with the `ASP.NET and web development` and `.NET desktop development` workloads with .NET 8 SDK installed.
You can build and run the project by opening the solution file `TodoCrud.sln` in Visual Studio and running the `Api` and `WinForms` projects.
Alternatively, you can use the command line:
```bash
cd Api
dotnet run
```
Then, in another terminal:
```bash
cd WinForms
dotnet run
```
Running tests can be done via Visual Studio Test Explorer or the command line:
```bash
dotnet test
```

## Assumptions and Limitations
- The application is designed for local use with a SQLite database file, and thus does not support multi-user scenarios.
It is however easily adaptable to other databases supported by Entity Framework Core.
- The frontend is a simple Windows Forms application, which is outdated and not cross-platform.
- The API is set to seed the database with some initial data on startup.
- The API does not implement any form of authentication or authorization.
- The data model, consisting of only the `Task` entity, contains the following fields:
  - `Id` (int) which is an auto-incrementing primary key.
  - `Title` (string) which can be between 1 and 140 characters.
  - `Completed` (bool) false by default.
  - `DueDate` (DateTime, optional) where null means no due date.
  - `CreatedAt` (DateTime) which is managed by the backend and set to the current date/time when the task is created.
  - `UpdatedAt` (DateTime) which is managed by the backend and set to the current date/time whenever the task is updated.
  - `Tags` (a list of strings) which can contain any number of strings of any length.
- The API exposes the following endpoints:
  - `GET /tasks?query={string}&completed={bool}&sorting={int}` to retrieve all tasks, optionally filtered by a search query (which matches the title or tags) and/or completion status.
Sorting parameter indicates sorting mode. Tasks are sorted by Id by default.
  - `POST /tasks` to create a new task with a JSON body containing the `Title`.
  - `PUT /tasks/{id}` to update an existing task with a JSON body containing any subset of the fields `Title`, `Completed`, `DueDate`, and `Tags`.
  - `DELETE /tasks/{id}` to delete a task by its ID.

## Potential Future Improvements
- Implement authentication and authorization for the API.
- Separate the TodoApiClient into its own project or a shared library.
- Implement pagination for the `GET /tasks` endpoint and the frontend.
- Migrate the frontend to a more modern framework, ideally a web-based one.
- Add logging and monitoring for the API.
- Implement a more realistic tagging system, possibly with a separate `Tag` entity.

## Generated Content
Many parts of this project were generated by Visual Studio templates.
In addition, coding was done with the assistance of AI (GitHub Copilot).
Of particular note:
- Api/seed.json was entirely generated by AI.
- Api.Tests/TaskControllerTests.cs was mostly generated by AI.
